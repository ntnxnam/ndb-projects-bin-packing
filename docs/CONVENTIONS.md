Terms used in the data and the app.

| **Max parallelization** | More people → shorter calendar time, up to the point work can’t be split. Not all projects can be fully parallelized. |
| **60% capacity** | Only 60% of a person’s time is counted for this planning; the rest is other work. |
| **3 devs : 1 QA** | One QA per three developers. Reflected in the source CSV’s “Total resources required”. |
| **Sizing “up to”** | Each band (XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL, 3L, 4L) means the project will take **up to** that many months. |

Bar **length** = duration (months). Bar **thickness** = FTE (total resources).
